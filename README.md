#Game suite

#The main idea of my project will be to create a game suite with three different games. The user will choose which game they would like to play. The games will ask for user input and have a response based on the input.  The games that I am thinking of are Rock  paper scissor, a Mad Lib and then a fortune teller. After the game is complete the user has the option to play again or end.
